<h1>Homework 7: Census data choropleth </h1>
<h2>Logan Timm</h2>
<h3>I chose to look at data from Virginia because I grew up and went to school in southern VA. 
    What I really wanted to investigate was public education funding by county because schools 
    in southern VA are are typically inferior to those in northern VA in terms of physical 
    attributes and opportunities. Growing up in SOVA (southern VA), we were always told how we 
    would never be able to compete with kids from NOVA when it came time for college applications, 
    etc. I could not find data for public education funding, but what I ended up using was the number 
    of residents per county of the age 25 or older who obtained a Bachelor's degree or higher. I was 
    hoping this would relate by showing that there was a higher concentration in NOVA, but as you 
    can see there are very few data points throughout Virginia except for the Washington D.C. area.</h3>
