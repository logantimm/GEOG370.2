<h1>Homework 8: Census data ratios and categories </h1>
<h2>Logan Timm</h2>
<h3>The following maps are ratios of the population of the ages 25 and up that have a Bachelor's degree 
    or higher compared to the total number of individuals ages 25 and up in each county in Virginia.</h3></br>
<h3>The first map ratio is done using natural breaks as the categorization mode. This is the most straightforward way
    to categorize data, although it can creat categories that contain varying nubmers and outliers.

    </a></br>
<h3>The second map ratio is done using pretty breaks as the categorization mode. This method of categorization has 
    a more pleasing legend, but due to the unnatural breaks, can make the ratios seem more extreme and shift the data 
    towards outliers.</datagrid></h3>

    </a></br>
<h3>The last map ratio is done using equal quantiles as the categorization mode. The legend with this categorization 
    is very easy to read, but equal interval can cause most of the data values to fall into one or two of the categories
and leave the other categories with very few values.</h3>
