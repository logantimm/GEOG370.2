<h1>Chloropleth of National Parks in the U.S.</h1>
<h2>Logan Timm</h2>
<h3>I love our nation's beautiful parks and reserves. For this project, I simplified the dataset to only look at 
    only National Parks rather than look at all federally maintained natural areas. I wanted to see which states had 
    more area of natural park land than others, so if you could only choose a few states to visit you could 
    make the most of your time.</h3></br>
<h3>The following map is a chloropleth of the cumulative area of national parks in each state. 
    As you can see, Alaska clearly has significantly more area than any other state.</h3></br>

<h3>The second map is done excluding Alaska from the dataset to see a more accurate representation
     of the differences between states.</h3>
